âš¡ What is decorator?
A decorator is a function that takes a function object as its argument,
and returns a function object,
and in the process, makes necessary modifications to the input function,
possibly enhancing it.

The result of the wrapping?

   1. Adds functionality of the function.
   2. Modifies the behavior of the function.
"""

"""
âš¡ A little bit of theory about functions:
- Functions are objects like every other
- They can be assigned to variables and passed around
- Let's inspect some function: 
    __repr__()
    __name__
    __doc__
    __call__()
